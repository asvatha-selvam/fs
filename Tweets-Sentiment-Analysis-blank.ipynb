When you add water, it flows through the body that helps in the shaping, once you shape it you will find extra clay sticking out, only if you’re aware of your body can you trim the growth to make it whole again. Once you do that, you create a piece that lasts for years. All of this only if you take care of it from the start. 🦶🏾\n",

So one such night, very lovingly he asked me to make dosas for him and man did I nail that dosa, it was rounder than the sun. I didn’t know if I would carry it forward in Chennai but Vikram’s hashtag manifested itself, I deleted Swiggy (spent 20k on an average every month), bought groceries and for the first time I made myself some dinner. Is it joy or is it joy? Huh? Yes jet lagged so dinner at 6pm. \n",

I also taught two types of liners that I love - a wing for different eye shapes and a smokey liner perfect for any event. \n",

So to finally have salt in my toothpaste was great. Brushing your teeth keeps your teeth safe from infections and cavities.

We would lean on each other when life’s unfair and hug each other when everything’s good, be there for each other when one needs, prank each other when we are bored and so on and so forth. This was the kind of friendship I dreamt of as a kid and I’m so glad I have that now. @fahadahmedshaik you’re truly the best friend anyone can ever have. From irritating me at 12am and confessing some truths to my mother at 6am, to asking a 1000 questions for everything and forever loving me unconditionally.

Before I left I asked you guys if I should start a travel blog and phewww it ain’t easy to note down everything, take nice pictures, give all the details especially when there’s so much to see and explore, however I’ve gathered all that I can and will be putting out my first ever travel blog on my fav place in the whole world :\n",

To this day, summer is my fav season because my dad used to let us go to madras only during summer holidays and I loveddddd madras. I was a very naughty child (DUH) and refused to eat so ammama used to take me to the road, show me all the kannu kutties from the opposite milk pannai and only then I would eat. And of course I was obsessed with #superstar and used to sing “Vandhenda Paal Kaaren” all the time. I believe I told ammama that I want to become a paalkaari growing up and that’s probably why I chase the famous Lakshmi. I have to dedicate this to ammama for all the stories about cows she’s told me and for endlessly loving me. \n",

But the one thing she never forgot was her violin, she would play any Raagam I’d ask her to play and I was stunned. Illness can take away anything from you, not your passion. \n",

I can go penniless faster than you can imagine. But what are we promoting here? I feel like there’s a lot more selling and very less learning. Raising voices for causes, for people, for love isn’t prevailing or I don’t know if I’m following the wrong ones. This following, need and greed for likes and numbers has to stop. I don’t want to be judged based on what my social media numbers are or how expensive the things I post about are or the cool people I spend my time with. You’re just as cool as the coolest person. Nothing in life comes easy guys, everything comes with a price. Also everything is subjective, for you, I might look cool, for me someone else might look cool. But is that all we care about ? What about all the people that don’t have a meal? That don’t have a roof over their head? All the people fighting for their life? All the girls hiding in the dark because of abuse? There’s a bigger picture to life. You’ve lived a rich life only when you’re of good use to somebody. \n",

I don’t know the reasons but I haven’t gained weight since 9th standard, nor have I grown taller since then. But over the years people have constantly asked me if my mom cooks at all, if I eat at all, why I’m so thin, I’d look better if I gained weight, I have to put on 5kgs bla bla bla. There were also people who always asked me how I look so fit all the time.

Everyone fights a battle that we know nothing about. I have had some battles myself one after the other and I was a weakling. Somehow my soul kept pushing me to look forward and I ended up at the door steps of Down syndrome federation of India. My life changed that very moment when I met Babli, Arti, lavanya, Jayanti and hundreds of other children that day.

They’re the energy that cleanses this place, they’re the catalyst for better people to exist and they’re all I need for my world to be better. My relationship with bubble is no different from that of siblings. She always showers me with love, never forgets to get me gifts when she travels, always blesses me with the fullest of heart and also humbles me and reminds me how grateful I should be. \n",

I remember the days when I thought only if I had a certain brand of a wallet, people would befriend me, how shallow was I? The reason those thoughts occur is because the world tells you, you are not enough, the people tell you Bata ain’t enough, people tell you Louis Vuitton is cool, but you know who these people are? They’re inside of you, it comes from an insecure place where you fill the void of self love with materials, problem is you’re never going to find peace with that attitude. Wake up everyday and say “I love myself”, a simple habit can become a lifestyle and soon you’ll realise all’s bullshhhhh and you are AWESOME.

I feel like a hypocrite because I’m also passing this message to you through social media but I’m hoping this will make you put your phone down and starting running at life like those dogs that wander on the streets.

This has become a platform to SELL. But do remember they are all just like you and are not dropped from heaven, they do have problems but choose to show the best version of themselves on this screen. When I say they, I’m one of them too. So don’t be taken aback with everything you see on Instagram, everything is done with a purpose of wanting to make you feel a certain way. If it’s bringing you good feelings like inspiration, helps you boost your energy, helps you have better ambitions, no harm, but don’t let anything make you think you’re smaller. EVER.

Krishna, to contain him in these seven days is an impossible challenge. At the most we can just have a glimpse of who he is, and that glimpse should be more than enough. \n",

      "When I was 20 years old, I put together my first dance show with children from different economic backgrounds. It did really well, and when I was planning my next show, I came across an association for people with Down Syndrome. Soon, I began working with them. \n",
      "While society considers them to be mentally challenged, I could always only see the good. They know what they want and are so transparent. Their first response to meeting a stranger is to give them a hug––it’s innocence in its purest form. \n",
      "I still remember the time when I was anxious about getting my choreographer card issued in time––I was stressed and one of the girls at the foundation noticed. She took me to the temple and the very next day I got my card! I guess I knew then that there was divinity in my purpose and I was on the right path. \n",
      "It’s been 8 years now and I’ve been kind of a teacher here. The amount of love and loyalty I’ve received from them has taught me so much. It’s changed me––I’ve stopped judging people and I’ve felt free ever since. \n",
      "The truth is, people with Down Syndrome are just a little different––they’re definitely not lacking in any way. I’ll never understand how we always end up isolating the people that don’t look like us or behave like us. In fact, we’re the ones who have let our values slide, while people with an apparent ‘medical condition’ actually have it all figured out! Trust me, they’re not the crazy ones….we are.”\n",

      "I almost got caught in a plastic bag while swimming in the ocean. Plastic bags are lightweight and float easily, this means they can travel long distances when picked up by the wind. Often, the bags will fall along the coast and other areas of animal habitats, which creatures then attempt to eat, only to choke and eventually starve to death. After the animal carcass has rotted away, the bag is normally released – only for the whole process to be repeated again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Removing plastic bags from our society will not only rid us of waste and unnecessary expense, it will also help to protect our wildlife and landscape. 100,000 animals are killed by plastic bags every year.  #whatthefish #saveouroceans\n",

The left leg's cut open wound has healed pretty well, a little more to go though. The patch you see on his bum is the skin they used to graft his right leg, that will heal too.

This year I've educated close to 40 kids but next year is going to be crazy and I know it already. So do drop a mail to makeachangetrust@gmail.com if you want to adopt a few letters of change. We've 8000 letters adopted already but we are aiming at 1 million letters. Of course, when we have the power and love nothing can stop us.

Majority of the cost of the painting is going towards educating a child. Please ask me to paint you. A4 size : Rs.750 and A3 size : Rs.1000. If you think its expensive, remember, I need to paint it, frame it, courier it and also be able to help educate a child. So feel free to order NOW :D \n",

Something basic, if you need inspiration, you can use any of my pictures 🤪🤣 jk jk. But seriously this one is amazing, create a masterpiece. \n",

So I come home and start thinking why am I doing all this? What’s the purpose of my life? And start overthinking and came across this picture on my computer which reminded me what happiness is. I love my kids so much, just their photo brings so much joy and happiness. The lesson I take home after spending time with them is to JUST BE HAPPY.

I did food science and management in college but I hated the kitchen, I don’t enjoy it, I don’t understand cooking, it’s like how some people have a hard time with math, I love math but don’t like cooking, however all of that changed in Aussie this time. @sainath.sairamesh is particular about food, he’s been a vegan for a while and I was convinced to change into one myself so most of the food had to be prepared than ordered. So one such night, very lovingly he asked me to make dosas for him and man did I nail that dosa, it was rounder than the sun. I didn’t know if I would carry it forward in Chennai but Vikram’s hashtag manifested itself, I deleted Swiggy (spent 20k on an average every month), bought groceries and for the first time I made myself some dinner. Is it joy or is it joy? Huh? Yes jet lagged so dinner at 6pm. \n",

One thing I can't survive without is toothpaste, because my dad was very strict about brushing teeth in the morning and before going to bed. He wouldn't let me speak without brushing my teeth in morning. But when I go to surf I often forget to pack toothpaste and just hit the waters and the salt water takes care of it. So to finally have salt in my toothpaste was great. Brushing your teeth keeps your teeth safe from infections and cavities. And salt is an additional support💪 :) Can’t get enough of Colgate Active Salt?

We would lean on each other when life’s unfair and hug each other when everything’s good, be there for each other when one needs, prank each other when we are bored and so on and so forth. This was the kind of friendship I dreamt of as a kid and I’m so glad I have that now. @fahadahmedshaik you’re truly the best friend anyone can ever have. From irritating me at 12am and confessing some truths to my mother at 6am, to asking a 1000 questions for everything and forever loving me unconditionally. No it’s not his birthday, he just saved all of our conversations and he sent me a dance video I thought I lost. So giving him some overdue credit for everything. \n",

To this day, summer is my fav season because my dad used to let us go to madras only during summer holidays and I loveddddd madras. I was a very naughty child (DUH) and refused to eat so ammama used to take me to the road, show me all the kannu kutties from the opposite milk pannai and only then I would eat. And of course I was obsessed with #superstar and used to sing “Vandhenda Paal Kaaren” all the time.

I can go penniless faster than you can imagine. But what are we promoting here? I feel like there’s a lot more selling and very less learning. Raising voices for causes, for people, for love isn’t prevailing or I don’t know if I’m following the wrong ones. This following, need and greed for likes and numbers has to stop. I don’t want to be judged based on what my social media numbers are or how expensive the things I post about are or the cool people I spend my time with. You’re just as cool as the coolest person. Nothing in life comes easy guys, everything comes with a price. Also everything is subjective, for you, I might look cool, for me someone else might look cool. But is that all we care about ? What about all the people that don’t have a meal? That don’t have a roof over their head? All the people fighting for their life? All the girls hiding in the dark because of abuse? There’s a bigger picture to life. You’ve lived a rich life only when you’re of good use to somebody. \n",

Growing up I started having a very athletic body probably because my best friend and I were always playing on the roads. My teenage years were pretty hard, I was always asked if I eat at all, I was always called kaka because of my skin colour ( btw, kakas are beautiful and I love them ). I don’t know the reasons but I haven’t gained weight since 9th standard, nor have I grown taller since then. But over the years people have constantly asked me if my mom cooks at all, if I eat at all, why I’m so thin, I’d look better if I gained weight, I have to put on 5kgs bla bla bla. There were also people who always asked me how I look so fit all the time. The point I’m trying to make is, it is people’s job to make you feel like you’re not enough, and it’s your job to believe YOU ARE ENOUGH. \n",

They’re inside of you, it comes from an insecure place where you fill the void of self love with materials, problem is you’re never going to find peace with that attitude.

I can’t sit in one place for a long time unless there’s something engaging me. The reason I shared this today is most of the time we believe what we see on social media. This has become a platform to SELL. But do remember they are all just like you and are not dropped from heaven, they do have problems but choose to show the best version of themselves on this screen. When I say they, I’m one of them too. So don’t be taken aback with everything you see on Instagram, everything is done with a purpose of wanting to make you feel a certain way. If it’s bringing you good feelings like inspiration, helps you boost your energy, helps you have better ambitions, no harm, but don’t let anything make you think you’re smaller. EVER. Cuz you have a piece of the UNIVERSE inside you too :) #sundayfunday #notsofuncuzihavenothingtodo\n",

Krishna, to contain him in these seven days is an impossible challenge. At the most we can just have a glimpse of who he is, and that glimpse should be more than enough. \n",
      "This is the playfulness around him. These were absolutely dedicated to him, these people. Absolutely devoted to him, but this is the way they spoke about him. If you want to explore this path playfully, if you want to be playful you need a heart full of love, a joyful mind, and a vibrant body. Otherwise there is no Leela. Happy Birthday Baby Krishna ! :)\n",

When I told @fromage.un I wanna bring my friends along, the first question was, \" the people from your school? We would love to host you guys\". What am absolute charm it was to be hosted by you guys. The respect and attention you gave the children definitely would have made the parents of these people trust more in the society.

      "“My best friend, while growing up, was deaf and mute––it was because of him that I grew more sensitive around differently abled people. And every step I took in my life, was so that I could do more for them. \n",
      "When I was 20 years old, I put together my first dance show with children from different economic backgrounds. It did really well, and when I was planning my next show, I came across an association for people with Down Syndrome. Soon, I began working with them. \n",
      "While society considers them to be mentally challenged, I could always only see the good. They know what they want and are so transparent. Their first response to meeting a stranger is to give them a hug––it’s innocence in its purest form. \n",
      "I still remember the time when I was anxious about getting my choreographer card issued in time––I was stressed and one of the girls at the foundation noticed. She took me to the temple and the very next day I got my card! I guess I knew then that there was divinity in my purpose and I was on the right path. \n",
      "It’s been 8 years now and I’ve been kind of a teacher here. The amount of love and loyalty I’ve received from them has taught me so much. It’s changed me––I’ve stopped judging people and I’ve felt free ever since. \n",
      "The truth is, people with Down Syndrome are just a little different––they’re definitely not lacking in any way. I’ll never understand how we always end up isolating the people that don’t look like us or behave like us. In fact, we’re the ones who have let our values slide, while people with an apparent ‘medical condition’ actually have it all figured out! Trust me, they’re not the crazy ones….we are.”\n",

      "I almost got caught in a plastic bag while swimming in the ocean. Plastic bags are lightweight and float easily, this means they can travel long distances when picked up by the wind. Often, the bags will fall along the coast and other areas of animal habitats, which creatures then attempt to eat, only to choke and eventually starve to death. After the animal carcass has rotted away, the bag is normally released – only for the whole process to be repeated again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Removing plastic bags from our society will not only rid us of waste and unnecessary expense, it will also help to protect our wildlife and landscape. 100,000 animals are killed by plastic bags every year.  #whatthefish #saveouroceans\n",

I don't know if people will love him as much as I do and I wouldn't want anyone to think my son as a burden\" , sad his dad to me. This statement was simply the only reason why @aplusmax was started.

The best gift you've ever received is this body of yours and you constantly abandoning it is only making it worse for you. And I said to my body, softly, \"I want to be your friend\". It took a long breath and replied, \"I've been waiting my whole life for this\". My body is the best thing that's happened to me.

The left leg's cut open wound has healed pretty well, a little more to go though. The patch you see on his bum is the skin they used to graft his right leg, that will heal too. He's eating properly but appears to be thin probably because of the surgery. My update : pattotie is being brought back to life, thanks to all the donors and well wishers.

This year I've educated close to 40 kids but next year is going to be crazy and I know it already. So do drop a mail to makeachangetrust@gmail.com if you want to adopt a few letters of change. We've 8000 letters adopted already but we are aiming at 1 million letters. Of course, when we have the power and love nothing can stop us.

Majority of the cost of the painting is going towards educating a child. Please ask me to paint you. A4 size : Rs.750 and A3 size : Rs.1000. If you think its expensive, remember, I need to paint it, frame it, courier it and also be able to help educate a child. So feel free to order NOW :D \n",

I couldn't afford the expensive ones but I troubled my mom to get me these. I remember they costed Rs.1499. I will treasure them forever.
